                    <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid
                    snowboarder. During the warmer months here in Utah, I enjoy fishing,
                    boating, and camping.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I am constantly looking at some of the outbreaks in technology and new ideas on how I can 3D print something or even design 3D Models.</p>
